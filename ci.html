            <h2>Problem Space and How It Was Arrived At</h2>
            <p>
                The problem space for our project is derived from conversations with travelers and observing common pain points in their travel experiences. We realized that there was a need for a platform that could simplify travel planning while prioritizing convenience, sustainability, and safety. This insight led us to focus on creating a solution that leverages smart algorithms and an intuitive design to streamline the travel experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our findings from research and discussions identified that there was a gap in the market for a comprehensive travel platform that not only helps with logistics but also contributes to sustainable travel practices. The idea of combining technology with eco-friendly solutions emerged as a key theme. This formed the foundation for our project: a travel app that uses AI to optimize travel plans based on individual preferences and sustainable practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                In reflecting on city design, we explored how urban spaces can benefit from smarter travel solutions. The goal is to make cities more efficient and enjoyable for travelers while contributing to long-term sustainability. The business cases were identified through a deeper analysis of the travel ecosystem, including transportation, accommodation, and user behavior patterns.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem Definition and Team Details</h2>
            <p>
                The problem we aim to solve is the complexity of travel planning, focusing on the need for a platform that integrates smart algorithms for efficient trip management, while also promoting sustainable and safe travel practices.
            </p>
