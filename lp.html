        <h2>1. Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking</h2>
        <p>Problems in nature can be solved using iteration, recursion, or backtracking. Iteration involves repeating steps, like counting animal populations or watching seasonal changes. Recursion solves problems by breaking them into smaller parts, such as the patterns of tree branches or fractals in snowflakes. Backtracking explores all possible options and returns to try a different path if needed, like ants searching for food or animals solving mazes.</p>
        <h3>Iteration Example: Factorial Calculation</h3>
        <pre><code>
            long long factorial (int n)
            {  
                long long result = 1;
                for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
                    result *= i;
                }
                return result;
            }
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Recursion Example: Fibonacci Series</h3>
        <pre><code>
            int fibonacci(int n)
            {
                if (n <= 1) {
                    return n;
                }
                return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
            }
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Recursion Example: Tower of Hanoi</h3>
        <pre><code>
            #include <stdio.h>
            void towers(int n, char from, char to, char aux)
            {
                if (n == 1) {
                    printf("Move disk 1 from %c to %c\n", from, to);
                    return;
                }
                towers(n - 1, from, aux, to);
                printf("Move disk %d from %c to %c\n", n, from, to);
                towers(n - 1, aux, to, from);
            }
            
            int main() 
            {
                int n;
                printf("Enter the number of Disks to be moved\n");
                scanf("%d", &n);
                towers(n, 'A', 'C', 'B');
                return 0;
            }
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Backtracking Example: N-Queens Problem</h3>

        <p>Space efficiency is about how much memory an algorithm uses, and time efficiency is about how fast it runs. These are important because they help us choose algorithms that can handle large tasks without using too much memory or taking too long. For example, algorithms that take constant time (O(1)) or logarithmic time (O(log n)) are very fast. However, those with quadratic (O(n²)) or exponential time (O(2ⁿ)) can be too slow for large problems. Choosing efficient algorithms is crucial in real-world tasks like processing data or running programs smoothly.</p>

        <h3>3. Takeaways from Chapter 2 Design Principles</h3>
        <p>Key design principles include divide and conquer, greedy methods, dynamic programming, and abstraction. Divide and conquer breaks problems into smaller pieces, solves them, and combines the results, like in merge sort. Greedy methods focus on making the best choice at every step, such as finding the shortest route in a map. Dynamic programming stores solutions to smaller problems to avoid repeating work, like calculating Fibonacci numbers. Abstraction helps simplify problems by focusing only on what matters and ignoring extra details, like in object-oriented programming.</p>

        <h4>Divide and Conquer</h4>
        <pre>
            <code>
                ALGORITHM MergeSort(A[0..n-1])
                    if n > 1
                        copy A[0...n/2 - 1] to B[0...n/2 - 1]
                        copy A[n/2 ... n - 1] to C[0...n/2 - 1]
                        MergeSort(B)
                        MergeSort(C)
                        Merge(B, C, A)

                ALGORITHM Merge(B, C, A)
                    i <- 0

        <h3>4. The Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h3>
        <img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/iJgItT1WOBadn4NGle/giphy.gif" alt="Tree Data Structure" />
        <p>Tree structures are useful for organizing and solving problems efficiently. Binary search trees (BSTs) are good for fast searching and sorting. Self-balancing trees like AVL trees or red-black trees ensure operations remain quick even as the tree grows. Tries are special trees for working with words, such as in auto-complete suggestions. Heaps are trees used to manage priorities, such as finding the largest or smallest item quickly. These structures are essential for handling complex tasks in an organized way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tree</strong>: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST)</strong>: A tree where each node has at most two children, with the left child smaller and the right child larger than the parent.</li>
            <li><strong>AVL Tree</strong>: A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance during insertion and deletion.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap</strong>: A complete binary tree where parent nodes are compared to child nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Trie:</strong> Specialized for prefix-based search.</li>
             <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A balanced BST ensuring logarithmic time operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Need for Array Query Algorithms</h2>
        <img src="https://scaler.com/topics/images/the-sum-of-values-segment-tree.gif" alt="Segment Tree Example">
        <p>Array query algorithms help retrieve and update data quickly. For example, prefix sums can calculate the total of a range in an array very fast. Segment trees and Fenwick trees are advanced tools that allow for both updates and queries efficiently. These algorithms are used in applications like tracking scores, stock prices, or rainfall over time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Segment Tree:</strong> Handles range queries efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Fenwick Tree:</strong> Optimized for cumulative frequency queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Sparse Table:</strong> Precomputes answers for range queries.</li>

        <h2>Differentiation Between Trees and Graphs</h2>
        <img src="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="Trees vs Graphs">
        <p>Trees and graphs represent data differently and are used for distinct purposes. Trees are hierarchical with a single root and no cycles, like family trees or file systems. Graphs, on the other hand, are more general, allowing multiple connections and cycles, such as in social networks or transportation systems. Trees have specific traversals like preorder, inorder, and postorder for structured data exploration, while graphs use BFS and DFS for navigating interconnected data.</p>

        <h2>Sorting and Searching Algorithms in Real-World Contexts</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/6319642/screenshots/14533255/sorting.gif" alt="Sorting Algorithms">
        <p>Sorting and searching algorithms are essential for managing and retrieving data efficiently. Sorting algorithms, such as merge sort and quick sort, organize data in a specified order, which is vital for applications like e-commerce and data analysis. Merge sort uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, while quick sort selects a pivot to partition and sort the data. Searching algorithms, such as binary search, allow for quick retrieval of items from sorted lists by halving the search space repeatedly. This makes them ideal for applications like finding records in databases or locating files.</p>

        <h2>Importance of Graph Algorithms</h2>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*fnYx_2nBxic7Gz4u4c3ZPg.gif" alt="Graph Algorithms">
        <p>Graph algorithms play a vital role in solving problems related to networks and connections, particularly through spanning trees and shortest paths. A spanning tree connects all vertices in a graph without cycles, using the minimum number of edges, which is essential for optimizing network design and infrastructure. Algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's help identify minimum spanning trees for efficient communication networks and road systems. Shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford, find the most efficient route between nodes, which is crucial for GPS navigation and logistics.</p>

        <p><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> This technique involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and combining their results. It is effective for problems that can be recursively divided, as seen in algorithms like merge sort and quick sort.</p>
        <p><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> This method is used for optimization problems with overlapping subproblems, storing the results of solved subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It is commonly applied in scenarios like the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem.</p>
        <p><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Greedy techniques make locally optimal choices at each step, aiming for a global optimum. They are particularly useful for problems like minimum spanning trees and activity selection, where local decisions lead to overall efficiency.</p>
        <p><strong>Backtracking:</strong> This technique explores all possible solutions by trying partial solutions and abandoning them when they fail to meet criteria. It is commonly applied in constraint satisfaction problems, such as the N-Queens problem and solving mazes.</p>
